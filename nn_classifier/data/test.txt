My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.
She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker.
She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.
I was hoping there were more where those came from.
This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however.
There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops.
There is a "Fresh and Fruity" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled "I Scream for Quick Pops!", "Bake Shop", and  "Coco Loco".
As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on "Tips" and "Techniques" are useful.
There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual.
The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops.
Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well.
This is okay for chopping cilantro, but does not puree very well.
I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name.
My original mini prep had a sharp blade, not a serrated blade.
I got years of use out of it, and I wouldn't have replaced it but my husband mistakenly through the lid out in the trash.
This one is only so so, and food gets caught in the teeth of the serrated blade.
This was a replacement for a Krupps processor and I only used it 3 times.
I had to buy a Phillips to replace it.
It's so small (of course) and it's really only good for nuts.
I have Black & Decker that does a better job.
My big Cuisinart broke so I thought for a small size it would be good.
Did not even crush wet beans or move it to the top as said.
It was to late for me to return it.
This is my very first mini processor, i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.
Its a good size for that purpose,small enough i can leave it on the counter top.
However, i am disappointed after my first try.
i dont know what im doing wrong, if anyone has any suggestions - feel free to help me out.
Well, it worked for 10 seconds and then died.
The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.
I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.
There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.
Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!.
I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush.
When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant, so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush.
I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly.
Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit.
This thing will likely liquify them too....not a great product.
